## Before we talk about GraphQL

Lets talk about ...

---

## Why do we build services?

<Appear>
  <div>Simple Deployment Scheme</div>
  <div>Single Source of Truth</div>
  <div>Scalable</div>
  <div>I see my neighbors doing it</div>
</Appear>

The simplified model allows us to manage business logic centrally separate from UX.
This lends itself to being a single source of Truth.
Additionally allows us to scale to a given load.
All the cool kids are doing it.
SAAS, N-Tier, Microservices, Think Client, etc.  All the language for the past 20-ish years has assumed the existence of a service tier
```

### Common Aspects of Successful API's

<Appear>
  <div>Documented</div>
  <div>Accessible</div>
  <div>Transparent</div>
  <div>Flexible</div>
  <div>Scalable</div>
  <div>Fast</div>
  <div>Enjoyable</div>
  <div>

  </div>

I'm sure there are other aspects that are important but I think this list takes care of all major concerns from both engineer and the customer/business
```

---

## Categories of API Design

<div>Stateful</div>
<div>Stateless</div>

```notes
If we consider API construction as these 2 categories we can better reason about them
```

---

## Stateful | TCP

<Appear>
  <div>CORBA</div>
  <div>Thrift</div>
  <div>Protobuf</div>
  <div>grpc</div>
  <div>
    <img src="./images/dogs.gif" />
  </div>
</Appear>

## Stubs & Skeletons

- IDL Based
- Code Generation
- Object Based (Mostly...)

---

## Difficulties

- Documentation is there, IDL _is_ the Contract
- Accessible via Code
- Transparent through IDL
- Flexible, requires change to IDL contracts :(
- Fast, very fast at the cost of transparency
- Scalable, depends
- Enjoyable?

```notes
With Stateful APIs we knowingly sacrifice clarity/accessibility in favor of speed.
Ultimately this group has value but is out of scope for our discussion.
```

---

## Stateless | HTTP

<Appear>
  <div>SOAP</div>
  <div>HTTP+XML</div>
  <div>REST</div>
  <div>HTTP+JSON</div>
  <div>GraphQL</div>
  <div>
    <img src="./images/airplane.gif" />
  </div>
</Appear>

```notes

```

---

## Lets get this out of the way first ...

- Slower
- Accessible and Transparent by design
- Scalable as a concequence of design

```notes
How many of you work in legacy systems that use SOAP interfaces and connect to it from Node.js?
Mustache Templates work wonders here
```

---

## So, um...

What do all of these have in common?

---

## Stateless API's are essentially...

<Appear>
  <div>Documents</div>
  <div>Metadata</div>
</Appear>

```notes
2 clicks

Documents, documents, documents
Really we are just looking at querying and manipulation of data in different ways
Tooling.  XML's story is difficult and struggles.
REST/HTTP+JSON - Relies more on HTTP Verbs in conjunction with payload and URI
```

---

## Soap | HTTP+XML

- Tooling - `SAX`, `XSLT`, `XPath`, `XQuery`, et al
- [WSDL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensepost/wikto/master/Web%20References/com.google.api/GoogleSearch.wsdl) (IDL?)
- Schema | DTD

---

## Soap Example

```XML
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>

<soap11:Envelope
   xmlns="urn:GoogleSearch"
   xmlns:soap11="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
  <soap11:Body>
    <doGoogleSearch>
      <key>00000000000000000000000000000000</key>
      <q>shrdlu winograd maclisp teletype</q>
      <start>0</start>
      <maxResults>10</maxResults>
      <filter>true</filter>
      <restrict></restrict>
      <safeSearch>false</safeSearch>
      <lr></lr>
      <ie>latin1</ie>
      <oe>latin1</oe>
    </doGoogleSearch>
  </soap11:Body>
</soap11:Envelope>
```

---

## Soap Issues

- Tooling
- Confusion - `Element` vs `Attribute`
- Fits most aspects of a successful API but ...
- V e r b o s e
- Pass√©
- Fun?

---

## REST | HTTP+JSON

- Far less tooling
- REST (HTTP Verb + URL = Aweseomeness)
- Fits most aspects of a successful API
- En Vogue
- Fun

---

## REST Example

```
GET /people/1 HTTP/1.1
Host: mysite.com
Accept: */*
```

```JSON
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Lydon",
  "nickname": "Johnny Rotten",
  "occupation": "Singer/Songwriter"
}
```

---

### REST Issues

- Balance between Headers and Payload
- RPC operations
- Multi Request, (HTTP 2.0 can reduce this)
- Not flexible

---

### GraphQL

- JSON is Transport
- Describes 2 Components (Query & Variables)
- DSL for querying, mutations, and subscriptions
- Transparent, Accessible, Flexible, Faster on aggregate.

---

### GraphQL Request

```
{
  "query": "query { authors(id: 1) { ... }}",
  "variables": {}
}
```

---

### GraphQL Documented

- Type definitions can include inline documentation
- Keeping documentation as part of the definition means no lose ends

---

### Schema

```GraphQL
"""
Type representing an Author
"""
type Author {
  firstName: String
  lastName: String
  nickname: String @deprecated

  """
  Collection of books
  """
  books: [Book]
}
```

---

### GraphQL Accessible, Transparent, & Flexible

- Open Queryable Language
- Able to recursively fetch entities
- Not bound to a Database

---

### GraphQL Example

```GraphQL
query {
  authors(id: 1) {
    firstName
    lastName
    books {
      title
      publisher
      authors {
        firstName
        lastName
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

### Additional Fun

- Directives
- Mutations
- Subscriptions
- Not limited to HTTP, but can work over any Transport. Its just a document

---

### Directives

```GraphQL
directive @authorized (role: String!) on FIELD_DEFINITION

SCHEMA
SCALAR
OBJECT
ARGUMENT_DEFINITION
INTERFACE
UNION
ENUM
ENUM_VALUE
INPUT_OBJECT
INPUT_FIELD_DEFINITION
```

---

### Mutations

```gql
mutation UpdateThings($person: UpdatePersonInput) {
  updatePerson(person: $person) {
    success
    validations {
      code
      message
    }
  }
}
```

---

### Subscriptions

```gql
subscription NotifyMeOfStuff($stuffILike: StuffConfig) {
  stuffNotifications(config: $stuffILike) {
    state
    message
  }
}
```

Note: How subscriptions work is purely an implementation detail. GraphQL provides the language to describe a subscription an implementation will dictate the `how`

---

### Conclusion

<img src="./images/think.gif" />

```notes
GraphQL doesn't entirely replace the need for REST base or if you prefer SOAP based APIs but rather provides an alternative.
It can run side by side as more traditional API sets.
Its queryable and declarative.
```
